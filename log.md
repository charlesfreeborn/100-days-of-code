# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resumed the 100DaysOfCode Challenge having missed some couple of days. I will be working on my porfolio page for the freeCodeCamp 

**Thoughts:** My goal and motivation for taking up this challenge to be a front-end developer with special focus on JavaScript and React. I find the freeCodeCamp.
